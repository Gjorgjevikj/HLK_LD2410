# HLK-LD2410 library v 0.9.0

  Name: HLK_LD2410
  
  Purpose: Arduino library for the Hi-Link LD2410 24Ghz FMCW radar sensor

  @author Dejan Gjorgjevikj
  
  @version 0.9.0, 1/2024

  This sensor is a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar, which makes it good for presence detection and its sensitivity at different ranges to both static and moving targets can be configured.
 
  todo:
   - better documentation
   - examples
   - support for new firmware
   - support for other (simmilar) radar sensors 

Known limitations:
...
